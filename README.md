# Tweetur
A demo of Twitter written in Ruby on Rails. Users can make accounts and post "tweeets". Special credit goes to Andy Leverenz of Web-Crunch for being the original developer of this project. You can visit his profile in the following linK: https://github.com/justalever

This is a special version of the Twitter demo in that it fixes two major probelms present in the original project. For starters, deleting an account no longer causes bugs of any sort; create and destroy as you wish! Secondly, a pagination system has been added to the application so that there is no extreme overcrowding of "tweeets". Only a few will appear at a time (you can adjust this in the controller and views files) for an overall neater site appearance.
